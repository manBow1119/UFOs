# UFOs

### Project Overview
For this project a web-based visual was created to represent provided UFO data. The visualization provides an aesthetically pleasing interface displaying a table of UFO sighting information such as location, date, shape, duration, and related comments. The website allows users to filter through the data and display a new chart with location, data, and shape filters. Once these filters are applied the table updates to reflect the narrowed information.

### Results
The table on the website provides an organized way for the user to view pertinent information about each sighting from the database. By using one (or more) of the five filters, users can narrow their search. To use the filters, a user must simply type a value into one of the fields (following the template for date) and press enter or leave the field.
The pictures below show how the table responds to the applied filters:

### Summary
This project is a good start to providing interactive visualization of data to potential users. While the filters are a great way to narrow the search, there are some limitations. The most obvious limitation is the age and size of the dataset this table is filtered on. Since the data is a local reference, new data is not included in the filtered table. Future development of this project could be improved by scraping the information provided from multiple web sources. This would improve the visualization in a couple ways. First, the website could provide a "one-stop shop" eliminating the need for users to seek information from multiple sources. Additionally, web-scraping the data would allow for more up-to-date information about the most recent sightings.
